# Tello Rize Project
I have been looking for a way to:
- get state indicators from the Drone and update the browser in real time
- retrieve and display in the browser the stream from the Drone's video stream
- design some controllers with buttons and arrows to send commands to the Drone to pilot it

If you launch this project you will get the below screen on your browser. The screen is divided in 3 parts:
- real time indicators on the left
- stream of the video in the middle
- controllers on the right with flight logs on the bottom right
